# Adult Census Income Classification

This repository contains a complete machine learning workflow to predict income levels using the **Adult Census Income** dataset (often referred to as the "UCI Adult" dataset). The goal is to classify individuals into two groups: those earning `<=50K` and those earning `>50K` per year.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Acquisition:** Automating dataset download using `kagglehub`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, handling missing values (represented as `?`), and analyzing feature correlations.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning categorical features and encoding the target variable.
4. **Modeling:** Implementing a **Decision Tree Classifier**.
5. **Optimization:** Fine-tuning the model using `GridSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters for depth and leaf nodes.

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA
- **Imbalance:** The dataset is imbalanced, with roughly 76% of individuals earning ≤50K and 24% earning >50K.
- **Top Correlations:** `education.num`, `age`, and `hours.per.week` show the strongest positive correlation with higher income.
- **Marital Status:** Individuals in the "Married-civ-spouse" category have a significantly higher probability of earning >50K compared to other groups.

## 🛠️ Performance Metrics
After hyperparameter tuning, the best model achieved:
- **Test Accuracy:** ~85.3%
- **Precision:** ~76.6%
- **F1 Score:** ~0.648
- **Optimal Depth:** 10
