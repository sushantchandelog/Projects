# God Simulation and CO2 Emission Analysis

This repository contains two main projects: a philosophical simulation model and an analysis of CO2 emissions.

## Projects

### God Simulation Project

- **`god_simulation_project/main.ipynb`**: This notebook simulates a conversation between a "god" and a "prophet" to explore philosophical concepts.
- **`god_simulation_project/null_hypothesis.ipynb`**: This notebook contains a simulation for a null hypothesis related to the god simulation.

### CO2 Emission Analysis

- **`co_2_emmintion/carbon_emm.ipynb`**: This notebook loads and initially cleans the CO2 emission dataset.
- **`co_2_emmintion/carbon_emmision.ipynb`**: This notebook performs further data cleaning and preparation.
- **`co_2_emmintion/carbon_emmision_chart.ipynb`**: This notebook visualizes the cleaned CO2 emission data, showing trends and comparisons.

### Philosophy Model

- **`Philosophy_model.ipynb`**: This notebook trains a GPT-2 model on the writings of Plato to generate philosophical text.

## Usage

To run these notebooks, you will need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You will also need to install the required libraries for each project, which are listed at the beginning of each notebook.
